# TMDB React App

A simple application to search for movies by keyword or genre using API provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US).

## Run

Within the project directory run the below to start the server and view the application:
```
    npm start
```

## Purpose

This is my first application using the [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) framework. With a [Python](https://python.org) background in computations and procedural code, this was is the first public entry into the web development and full-stack software engineering space. Big thanks to the instructors of [The Ultimate 2023 Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp/?kw=the+ultimate+2023+fullstack&src=sac) for teaching many of the skills necessary to build this application. This application was built alongside the instructors but extended upon using knoweledge gained in throughout the course. On to the next!
